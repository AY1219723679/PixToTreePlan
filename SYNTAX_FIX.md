# Syntax Error Fix in main.py

## Problem
During batch processing, all images were failing with the following syntax errors in main.py:

```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
  File "c:\Users\Ay121\Documents\GitHub\PixToTreePlan\main.py", line 298
    print(f"  - Min region size: {args.min_region_size} pixels")    print(f"  - Min area ratio: {args.min_area_ratio * 100}%")
```

## Root Causes
1. **Joined Print Statements**: Two print statements were on the same line without proper separation
2. **Incorrect Indentation**: Several blocks had incorrect indentation
3. **Misaligned try-except**: The except block wasn't correctly aligned with its try block

## Fixes Applied
1. Added proper line breaks between print statements
2. Fixed indentation throughout the main function
3. Properly aligned the try-except block
4. Corrected indentation in the point cloud generation else clause

## Files Changed
- `main.py` - Fixed syntax errors

## Verification
The syntax errors have been fixed, and batch processing now works correctly. The main.py file compiles without errors and all the functionality has been preserved.

## How to Test
Run the batch processing script with a limited number of images:
```
python batch_process.py --max_images=2
```

## Additional Notes
The improved output folder structure continues to work as designed, with each image's outputs saved in a dedicated subfolder under the outputs/ directory.
